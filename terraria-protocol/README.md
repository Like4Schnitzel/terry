# terraria-protocol

This library contains all the packet definitions needed to work with
Terraria's multiplayer network protocol, and it can be used to build
a client, a robot, or even a custom Terraria server.

Note that the library itself doesn't do anything interesting, only the basics.
To see what can be built, refer to [terry], the original motivation behind
this work.
